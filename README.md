###Dynamical Analysis of Auditory Scenes

This repository is a workspace for EnviroSoundLab directed by David Dunn. The goal is to develop tools to quantify the temporal structure of events within an auditory scene via spectral analysis and dynamical systems analysis. This requires classifying sources / events of an audtiory scene and then analyzing the temporal structure of the sources / events.
